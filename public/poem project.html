 <h4>
  <p>
    Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high<br>
    Where knowledge is free<br>
    Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br>
    By narrow domestic walls<br>
    Where words come out from the depth of truth<br>
    Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br>
    Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br>
    Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit<br>
    Where the mind is led forward by thee<br>
    Into ever-widening thought and action<br>
    Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake<br>
